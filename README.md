# HashTable

I create a HashTable using the iHashTable interface. The HashTable works with Strings and uses linear probing to handle collisions.
A bridge element is maintained to ensure the algorithm will keep looking instead of terminating. BloomFilterJunior will implement a single prototype of a bloom filter. The main purpose is to check if a given value is a member of the bloom filter.
